Hi! Everyone calls me “JH” ¹. I spend a lot of time reading and writing code, mostly in Go these days. I also have shipped code in production in Elixir and Ruby and a few others since the beginning of my career. I like to build stuff and to exchange about it.

My primary technical focus is on backend, libraries and tooling, mainly in the context of cloud-based infrastructures. I have a deep interest in software development and its creative process, which led me to build a team centred around developer experience at my previous job.

I have worn multiple hats throughout my professional career: backend dev, engineering manager, entrepreneur and freelancer. I also have given courses on various technologies earlier in my career and have very fond memories of those. While my core interest is technical, being exposed to engineering challenges from various angles enabled me to build a broader understanding of how people, constraints and engineering relate to each other.

I live in Lyon, France. I work remotely and have been doing so for more than ten years now. It’s a really important part of my life. I love dogs and regularly share my office space with a Corgi. Think rubber duck debugging but with more interactivity!

Gaming is what I do to take my mind off things and have been doing so since I was a kid. That is what led to computers in the first place eh! I especially enjoy games when the computer throws random constraints and challenges at you, where skill translates into being able to adapt and overcome those random constraints.

My goals for 2021 are to focus on [coding](https://github.com/jhchabran), reading and [writing](/posts/).

{{< footnote >}}¹ Pronounced <a href="https://itinerarium.github.io/phoneme-synthesis/?w=/ʒiaʃ/">/ʒiaʃ/</a>. It's a common practice to abbreviate hyphenated firstnames by their initials in France. It started in my childhood and sticked since then. I grew to like it a lot, and it is much simpler to pronounce for everyone.{{</ footnote >}}
