Everyone calls me JH. I spend a lot of time reading and writing code, mostly in Go these days. I have used a variety of programming languages in my career and even more on my free time.

My primary technical focus in on backend, libraries and tooling, mainly in the context of cloud-based environments. I have a deep interest in development and its creative process, which led me to build a team centred around _developer experience_ at my previous job. I have taken many hats throughout my professional career: backend dev, engineering manager, entrepreneur and freelancer. I also have given courses on various technologies earlier in my career and have very fond memories of those.

I live in Lyon, France. I work remotely and have been doing so for more than ten years now. It's a really important part of my life. I love dogs and regularly share my office space with a [Corgi](https://instagram.com/romeo_the_corgi). Think rubberduck debugging but with more interactivity. I am and always have been an avid gamer. That is what led to to computers in the first place. [Roguelites](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Growth_of_the_rogue-lite_(2005-onward)>) are my jam these days and eat up most of my play time.

After a shift toward management in 2018 which has been a positive and incredibly rich experience, my goal for 2021 is to focus on [coding](https://github.com/jhchabran), [reading](https://goodreads.com/jhchabran)] and writing.
