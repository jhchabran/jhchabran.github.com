title: "About me"

Everyone calls me JH. I spend a lot of time reading and writing code, mostly in Go these days. I have used a variety of programming languages in my career and even more on my free time. I have a deep interest in development and its whole creation process, which led me to build a team centred around Developer Experience at my previous job. I have taken many roles in my professional career: software engineer, engineering manager, consultant, freelancer, and an entrepreneur. I also have given courses on various technologies earlier in my career and have very fond memories of those.

I live in Lyon, France. I work remotely and have been doing so for more than ten years now. It's a really important part of my life. I love dogs and regularly share my office space with a Corgi; he is a much more interactive than the rubber duck I previously used for debugging. I love gaming and have been doing so since very early on in my childhood. That is what led to to computers in the first place. Rogue-likes are my jam these days and represent most of my play time.

My goal for 2021 are to get back to being an individual contributor again, contributing to open source, and get back into writing.
