Everyone calls me JH. I spend a lot of time reading and writing code, mostly in Go these days, although I have shipped code in production with many others since the beginning of my career. I like to build stuff and to exchange about it.

I have a deep interest for software development and its whole creation process, which led me to build a team centred around Developer Experience at my previous job, which has been an incredible experience and have solidified my interest toward the technical side of things.

Being a rather curious person led me to build a quite broad experience, not only from a technical point of view, but also from various positions: software engineer, engineering manager, consultant, freelancer, and entrepreneur. While my core interest is technical, being exposed to engineering challenges from various angles while working a broad range of people has been a very enlightening experience.

I live in Lyon, France.
I work remotely and have been doing so for more than ten years now! It's a really important part of my life and what suits me best. I love dogs and regularly share my office space with a Corgi; he is a much more interactive than the rubber duck I previously used for debugging.

Gaming is what I do to take my mind off things and have been doing so since I was the kid. That is what led to to computers in the first place eh! I especially enjoy games when the computer throw random constraints and challenges at you, where skill equals to being able to adapt and overcome those random constraints.

My goal for 2021 are: to work as an individual contributor again, to contribute to open source, and get back into writing on a regular basis.
