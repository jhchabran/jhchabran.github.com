The feeling of having something modern, clean and simple, focusing on just what you need, providing new features like snippets, that cmd -T shortcut to jump to any file, it was just so cool.\nBut recently, things felt wrong.

No need to look at your keyboard and asking yourself why the fuck it’s ctrl-] to jump on a help subject, it’s just simple. Another cool one : moving around in Vim with jk keys is really nice, but as I still have to use arrows to browse in my cmd history, I can’t get my fingers escaping from those arrows. For sure another shortcut must exist to do that, there are many reasons to excuse this behavior, but it’s still not “great”, it’s just cool.\nYou’ll probably think by reading this that I’m an unsatisfied programmer who can’t find its editor (which is true) but the point isnnt exactly that.
