      <description>Vim users, myself included, often advocate about gaining speed, carving text like a ninja and banning that awful device named a mouse.
The follow-up to this is people saying, &amp;ldquo;Vim seems to be awesome but I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be that fast anyway.&amp;rdquo;
Each time I heard that, I tried to advocate about the fact that as a coder you&amp;rsquo;re staying around seven hours per day typing, so why not try something really efficient ?</description>

      <description>Not Rails: Rails isn&amp;rsquo;t the right answer for every project. Speeding up things with JRuby: basic example showing how JRuby obliterates MRI when it comes to threading. Building Mruby on Android : who thought that building mruby on Android would be so easy ? Fast Analytics with Redis : old tricks never dies, Redis and its bitwise operations to store analytics. Vim: efficient command mode: an interesting thread on reddit, found many Vim tips I never heard about.</description>
