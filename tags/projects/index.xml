      <description>I love hearing other developers recounting the story of how a project has started and evolved. There is so much to learn from others and what they experienced. I find it especially fascinating when the story is being told in an informal setting, allowing for anecdotes and personal insights to surface.
So I recently decided to build a blog where I collect interviews from open source contributors, How did it start?</description>
