      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;ve previously seen how to bootstrap a chrome extension with CoffeeScript. The next step is about adding testing support. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s a simple extension, the whole process of reloading the extension in the browser to manually test a feature is incredibly boring and error prone.

To illustrate, TabSwitcher will be used as an example, more specifically the match(url, abbreviation) function which returns a float, indicating how close is abbreviation is to url.</description>

      <description>TabSwitcher had been started one year ago, to showcase (see previous post) how a Chrome Extension using CoffeeScript can be built. I recently spend some time polishing it to bring it to the level of a decently featured extension.
Before describing the changes, what problem does it aims to solve ?

Switching between tabs like ninja I mostly work with more than thirty tabs opened in my browser.</description>

      <description>Ever had an idea for a great Chrome Extension ? Did you know that a chrome extension is just javascript ? And where there&amp;rsquo;s Javascript, we can write some CoffeeScript !
This post aims to give you an overview of building a chrome extension wrote in CoffeeScript. While being familiar with the latest is mandatory to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on there, no previous experience with Google Chrome is needed.
