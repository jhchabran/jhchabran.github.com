      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been eleven days since my last mixed links of the week.
So far I managed to build up enough motivation to write at least one article per week, thanks to this great book, I still have trouble posting these mixed links on a fixed day :).
Anyway, this week includes Ruby, Haskell, R, an interview, communications and a surprising initiative!

      <description>Not Rails: Rails isn&amp;rsquo;t the right answer for every project. Speeding up things with JRuby: basic example showing how JRuby obliterates MRI when it comes to threading. Building Mruby on Android : who thought that building mruby on Android would be so easy ? Fast Analytics with Redis : old tricks never dies, Redis and its bitwise operations to store analytics. Vim: efficient command mode: an interesting thread on reddit, found many Vim tips I never heard about.</description>
